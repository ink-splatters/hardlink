Other People's Code is handy for making directory hard-links in OSX.
Shamelessly cribbed from StackOverflow:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1432540 

Usage (assuming ~/bin is in your PATH):

gcc -o hln hln.c
gcc -o hunlink hunlink.c
mv hln ~/bin
mv hunlink ~/bin

hln /some/dir ~/linked_dir

Now your computer thinks those are exactly the same directory! Cool.
But don't delete linked_dir or it'll also delete /some/dir.
That's what hunlink is for:

hunlink ~/linked_dir

Neato.
